## get started
beat costs $7, which is a one-time payment that gives you access and lifetime updates, with no monthly subscriptions or additional fees. sponsor the github to unlock access to the [beatcorp/releases](https://github.com/beatcorp/releases) repository, where you’ll find the apk.

currently, it's only available on android, but we plan to release it on more devices and extend your one-time license to them. our web/desktop version is 50% done.
